# My Transit Lines
My Transit Lines is a Wordpress theme that adds a map-based framework for proposing new public transit lines, including vector data (lines and named or unnamed stations), title, description and transit mode. A front-end form is provided to enter such data and new transit line and/or station proposals are being saved as a custom "proposal" Wordpress post type. A tile-layout list shows all existing proposals including transit mode, title, and map.
The basic version was developed in summer 2014 by Johannes Bouchain (Hamburg, Germany) for the so called "Linie Fünf" (Line Five) project in Hamburg, and in fall 2014, the Berlin branch was launched, called "Linie Plus | Berlin". In 2016, the general version "Linie Plus | Extern" has been added, allowing to add proposals in any geographical region.
Until spring 2017, My Transit Lines has been developed locally. Then, the decision was taken to upload the theme to a Github repository for further community-based developments.
A detailed description of major issues and needed improvements will be added soon.
